(Converted from tables → clean structured list)

🔹 KPI 1 — Percentage of New MA Applications Completed Within a Specified Time Period

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures how many new MA applications were completed within the official processing timeline.

Formula:

Numerator: Number of new MA applications completed within the specified timeline

Denominator: Total number of new MA applications received in that period

(UNDA version): Denominator = number of new MA applications planned for completion

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:

Time counted from start of regulatory processing (screening/validation)

Excludes time when application is paused waiting for applicant input

Uses each NRA’s official public SLA timeline

AMRH Additional Requirement:
Two sub-indicators must also be tracked:

KPI 1.1 – Regional reliance positive outcomes within 90 working days

KPI 1.2 – Continental reliance positive outcomes within 90 working days

Alignment:

Harmonized across TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA

UNDA uses target-based denominator

🔹 KPI 2 — Percentage of Renewal MA Applications Completed Within a Specified Time Period

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures efficiency in completing renewal applications on time.

Formula:

Numerator: Renewal MA applications completed within timeline

Denominator: Renewal MA applications received

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:

Clock runs from screening/validation → final decision

Excludes applicant waiting time

Alignment:

Harmonized across TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA

UNDA does not track this KPI (renewals not yet priority)

🔹 KPI 3 — Percentage of Minor Variation MA Applications Completed Within a Specified Time Period

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures timeliness in evaluating minor variations.

Formula:

Numerator: Minor variation applications completed within timeline

Denominator: Minor variations received

UNDA denominator: minor variations planned for completion

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:

Start = screening/validation

End = final decision

Excludes hold time

Alignment:

TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA = fully harmonized

UNDA uses target-based denominator

🔹 KPI 4 — Percentage of Major Variation MA Applications Completed Within a Specified Time Period

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures if major variations are completed within required timelines.

Formula:

Numerator: Major variations completed on time

Denominator: Major variations received (UNDA = planned)

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:
Same as minor variations — measure only regulator processing times.

Alignment:

Harmonized across TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA

UNDA again uses planned denominator

🔹 KPI 5 — Percentage of Queries / Additional Information / FIRs Completed Within a Specified Time Period

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Tracks the efficiency of responding to queries, requests for additional information, and FIRs.

Formula:

Numerator: Queries / FIRs completed on time

Denominator: Queries / FIRs received (UNDA = planned)

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:

Measured from date of applicant's response → date regulator marks the query/FIR as completed

Applicant waiting time is excluded

Alignment:

Harmonized across TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA

UNDA uses planned denominator

🔹 KPI 6 — Median Time Taken to Complete a New MA Application

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures the median number of days needed to complete new MA applications.

Formula:

Arrange all completion times in ascending order

If odd number: median = middle value

If even: median = average of the two middle values

Unit: Days

Frequency: Annually

Timing rules:

Time measured from screening → final decision

Excludes applicant hold time

Notes:

Median preferred because mean can be distorted by outliers

Accepted as harmonized continental practice

Alignment:

Harmonized across all four NRAs (TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA, UNDA)

AMRH Extension:

KPI 6.1 – Median time for regional reliance pathway

KPI 6.2 – Median time for continental reliance pathway

🔹 KPI 7 — Average Time Taken to Complete a New MA Application

Maturity Level: 3
Type: Process
Definition: Measures the average time (mean) required to complete new MA applications.

Formula:

Numerator: Sum of all MA application completion times

Denominator: Number of new MA applications completed

Calculation: N ÷ D

Unit: Days

Frequency: Annually

Timing rules:
Same as KPI 6.

Notes:

NRAs comfortable using mean, but must check for outliers.

If too skewed, median should be preferred.

Alignment:

Harmonized across all four NRAs

🔹 KPI 8 — Percentage of Public Assessment Reports (PARs) Published Within Specified Timelines

Maturity Level: 4
Type: Output
Definition: Measures transparency by tracking publication of PARs for approved medicines.

Formula:

Numerator: PARs published within the specified timeline

Denominator: Total MAs granted in the period

Calculation: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Frequency: Quarterly

Timing rules:

Time measured from final MA decision → publication date

Specified timelines:

EFDA: 60 days

TMDA: 90 days

Rwanda FDA: TBD

Uganda NDA: TBD

Alignment:

Harmonized across TMDA, EFDA, Rwanda FDA, UNDA

Rwanda & UNDA still implementing publication systems
