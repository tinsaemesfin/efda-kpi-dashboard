1. Percentage of new clinical trial applications evaluated within a specified timeline

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Process
Definition: Measures how many new CT applications are evaluated within a predefined evaluation period.

Numerator: Number of new clinical trial applications evaluated within the specified timeline

Denominator: Total number of new clinical trial applications received

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes: Fully harmonized across all four NRAs (TMDA, EFDA, RFDA, UNDA)

2. Percentage of clinical trial amendments evaluated within specified timelines

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Process
Definition: Tracks timeliness of reviewing protocol amendments.

Numerator: Number of CT amendments evaluated within timeline

Denominator: Total CT amendments received

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes: Fully harmonized for all four NRAs

3. Percentage of approved and ongoing clinical trials inspected as per the GCP plan

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Output
Definition: Measures how many scheduled GCP inspections were completed.

Numerator: Number of approved & ongoing CTs inspected

Denominator: Total approved & ongoing CTs scheduled for GCP inspection

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Annual

Notes:

Harmonized for TMDA, EFDA, RFDA

Uganda NDA uses a modified definition (measured for CTs in a specific time period)

4. Percentage of field and safety reports assessed within a specified timeline

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Process
Definition: Measures timeliness of evaluating safety and field reports.

Numerator: Number of field & safety reports assessed within timeline

Denominator: Total field & safety reports received

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Differences:

Ethiopia FDA: counts safety reports only

Rwanda FDA: counts all reports

Uganda NDA: safety reports only + denominator tied to specific time period

5. Percentage of clinical trials compliant with GCP requirements

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Outcome
Definition: Tracks compliance with GCP based on inspection results.

Numerator: Number of clinical trials compliant with GCP

Denominator: Total number of CTs inspected

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes:

Harmonized for EFDA & UNDA

TMDA includes GCP + GCLP compliance

Rwanda FDA does not track as KPI (GCP is prerequisite for application)

6. Percentage of approved clinical trials listed in national registry

Maturity Level: 4
Indicator Type: Output
Definition: Measures publication of approved CTs to national registry.

Numerator: Number of approved CTs submitted for registry publication

Denominator: Total approved CTs

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes:

TMDA, EFDA, UNDA harmonized

UNDA registry automatically publishes → always 100%

RFDA: automatic publication → not tracked

7. Percentage of CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions) evaluated within specified timeline

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Process
Definition: Measures timeliness of CAPA evaluation following GCP inspections.

Numerator: Number of CAPA evaluated within timeline

Denominator: Total CAPA received

Formula: (N ÷ D) × 100

Unit: %

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes:

EFDA & UNDA harmonized

TMDA reports annually

Rwanda FDA tracks "technically" but not institutionally

8. Average turnaround time to complete evaluation of CT applications

Maturity Level: 3
Indicator Type: Process
Definition: Measures how long it takes to evaluate CT applications (in days).

Numerator: Sum of evaluation times for each application

Denominator: Total number of evaluated applications

Formula: N ÷ D

Unit: Days

Reporting Frequency: Quarterly

Notes:

Rwanda FDA, TMDA, Uganda NDA harmonized

EFDA reports semi-annually

This KPI supports KPI #1 (helps define timeline rules)

Supplemental KPIs (Not Harmonized)

These are extra KPIs tracked by individual NRAs.

📌 Supplemental KPIs — Ethiopia FDA

Indicator Type: Output

Formula: (Evaluated amendments ÷ amendments received) × 100

Frequency: Quarterly

3.1 Percentage of regulatory measures taken due to GCP findings and safety concerns

Indicator Type: Outcome

Formula: (Regulatory measures taken ÷ CTs conducted) × 100

Frequency: Quarterly

4.1 Percentage of received safety reports assessed

Indicator Type: Output

Formula: (Safety reports assessed ÷ received safety reports) × 100
